Features

Real-time stock data retrieval using yfinance
Calculation of technical indicators (SMA, RSI, Bollinger Bands)
Interactive stock price visualization with Matplotlib
Machine learning models for stock price prediction:

LSTM for time series forecasting
Random Forest for bullish/bearish classification


Natural Language Processing (NLP) integration for generating concise report summaries
User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit

Installation

Clone the repository:
shCopygit clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-analysis-predictor.git
cd stock-analysis-predictor

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
shCopypython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install the required packages:
shCopypip install -r requirements.txt

Set up your OpenAI API key:

Sign up for an account at https://openai.com/
Obtain your API key
Set it as an environment variable or update the open_api_key variable in the script



Usage

Run the Streamlit app:
shCopystreamlit run main.py

Open your web browser and go to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually http://localhost:8501)
Enter a stock symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple Inc.) in the input field
